                  I am a software engineer and recent graduate (University 
                  of British Columbia, BASc '16). Most recently, I co-founded 
                  Coachable, a company aiming to build an online platform to 
                  help fitness coaches manage their business and athletes. 
                  Prior to that, I interned as a software engineer at 
                  Microsoft, and Arista Networks.</p>

                <p class="description">After spending time powerlifting 
                    as a hobby, I realized there was a lack of software to 
                    help the communication between my coach and I, which is 
                    how the idea of Coachable arose. Coachable is a platform 
                    to help fitness coaches manage their business and 
                    athletes. As one of the founders, I worked closely with 
                    coaches to determine their biggest pain points and why 
                    they weren't using any existing solutions. I contributed 
                    to the front and back end of the web app, as well as 
                    created a REST API for the mobile app. I also set up 
                    automated builds and deployment to our development 
                    environment.</p>

                    Microsoft Vancouver, which allowed us to see a product

                    team of interns to design and develop a fitness app to 
                    compliment the Microsoft Band. I was the front-end 
                    developer on the team, and worked closely with the 
                    designer and back end developer to bring everything

                    nodes were unstable, the application was designed so nodes 
                    could enter and leave the cluster without service 
                    interruption. Key-value pairs were also replicated on 
                    three nodes so that if a node left, its store wasn't 
                    lost.</p>

                    Board and the Pi, which transfered data between the GPIO's 
                    quickly enough to stream video from the Pi, through the 
                    DE2, then to a VGA monitor. I also contributed to the
